\begin_layout Section
SI units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physics is a natural science.
 One of the key objectives of physics is to predict the future or outcome
 of events.
 It is a known fact that the laws of nature can be discovered and put up
 as simple relations of formulae using the language of Mathematics.
 The process of discovery of laws follows the steps of observation, measurements
 and finding the patterns.
 The repeating pattern itself become the laws.
 This can be termed as the scientific method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key step in any natural science is the idea of measurement.
 When we want to describe a phenomena or an event, it usually involves descripti
on of a physical quantity in terms of a number and the number is obtained
 through the process of measurement.
 For example if we want to describe a room, we could give its length, breadth
 and height, all of which will require measurements of length.
 In measurement we compare the physical quantity with a given standard size
 of the physical quantity which we call the unit of that physical quantity.
 In the measurement of the length of room we compare the length with the
 standard size-metre of the length and if we find that the room is 20 m
 long only means that the standard metre is contained 20 times in the total
 length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In nature we find that there are only a certain minimum number of quantities
 that we need to measure, all the rest can be described in terms of this
 minimum set of physical quantities.
 These are traditionally called the fundamental physical quantities and
 the units of these fundamental quantities are called fundamental or base
 units.
 In old times only length, mass and time were considered as fundamental
 and various countries and kings followed different sets of units for these.
 This often led to confusions and sometimes also critical accidents when
 not properly converted from one set of units to the other.
 In SI system of units there are seven quantities defined as the fundamental
 or base quantities.

\begin_layout Standard
All the quantities which are obtained as some combination of the base quantities
 are known as the derived quantities.
 Examples of derived quantities are force, velocity, acceleration, pressure,
 energy etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Uncertainty/Errors in measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete statement of a measured value should include an estimate of
 the level of confidence associated with the value.
 Properly reporting an experimental result along with its uncertainty allows
 other people to make judgments about the quality of the experiment and
 it facilitates meaningful comparisons with other similar values or a theoretica
l prediction.
 Without an estimated uncertainty, it would be impossible to answer the
 basic scientific questions such as: “Does my result agree with theoretical
 prediction or results from other experiments?” This question is fundamental
 for deciding if a scientific hypothesis is to be confirmed or refuted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we make a measurement, it is generally assumed that there exists a
 true value for any physical quantity being measured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement.
 In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as (a)
 systematic errors and (b) random errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Systematic errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The systematic errors are those errors that tend to be in one direction,
 either positive or negative.
 Some of the sources of systematic errors are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instrumental errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the
 measuring instrument, zero error in the instrument, etc.
 For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately
 calibrated (it may read 104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas
 it should read 100 °C); in a vernier callipers the zero mark of vernier
 scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale, or simply
 an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the temperature of a human body, a thermometer placed under
 the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of
 the body temperature.
 Other external conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind
 velocity, etc.) during the experiment may systematically affect the measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Personal errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
that arise due to an individual’s bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus
 or individual’s carelessness in taking observations without observing proper
 precautions, etc.
 For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the
 right while reading the position of a needle on the scale, you will introduce
 an error due to parallax.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Systematic errors can be minimised by improving experimental techniques,
 selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible.
 For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and
 the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Random errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The random errors are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are
 random with respect to sign and size.
 These can arise due to random and unpredictable fluctuations in experimental
 conditions (e.g.
 unpredictable fluctuations in temperature, voltage supply, mechanical vibration
s of experimental set-ups, etc), personal (unbiased) errors by the observer
 taking readings, etc.
 For example, when the same person repeats the same observation, it is very
 likely that he may get different readings everytime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimation of errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all sources of systematic uncertainties have been identified and reduced
 to a negligible level, statistical theory says that the mean is the best
 estimation to the true value.
 In formal mathematical terms, the mean value x of a set of N measurements
 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{N}}{N}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the summation sign 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is the shorthand notation indicating the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{N}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Absolute and mean absolute error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnitude of the difference between the individual measurement and the
 true value of the quantity is called the absolute error of the measurement.
 This is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 In absence of any other method of knowing true value, we considered arithmatic
 mean as the true value.
 Then the errors in the individual measurement values from the true value,
 are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Delta x_{1} & =x_{1}-\bar{x},\\
\Delta x_{2} & =x_{2}-\bar{x},\\
\ldots & \ldots\\
\Delta x_{n} & =x_{n}-\bar{x}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is taken as the final or
 mean absolute error of the value of the physical quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 It is represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{\text{mean}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\overline{\Delta x} & =\frac{\left|\Delta x_{1}\right|+\left|\Delta x_{2}\right|+\ldots+\left|\Delta x_{n}\right|}{n}\nonumber \\
\overline{\Delta x} & =\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left|\Delta x_{n}\right|}{n}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Relative and percentage error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative error is the ratio of the mean absolute error 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

 to the mean value 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

 of the quantity measured.
 Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{Relative error}=\frac{\overline{\Delta x}}{\bar{x}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the percentage error is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta x=\left(\frac{\overline{\Delta x}}{\bar{x}}\right)\times100\%
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Propagation/Combination of errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a physical quantity defined as a combination of other physical quantities,
 the error in the measurement of that physical quantity will be calculated
 based on the errors of all of the physical quantities on which it depends.
 The rules for combining errors are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Errors in addition and subtraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a physical quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 appears as the sum or difference of other physical quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=X\pm Y
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 yield the values 
\begin_inset Formula $X\pm\triangle X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\pm\Delta Y$
\end_inset

 then the error in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\triangle Z=\triangle X+\triangle Y.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Errors in multiplication and division
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a physical quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 appears as the product or division of other physical quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=X\times Y\,\,\,\text{OR}\,\,\,X/Y
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 yield the values 
\begin_inset Formula $X\pm\triangle X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\pm\Delta Y$
\end_inset

 then the fractional error in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\triangle Z}{Z}=\frac{\triangle X}{X}+\frac{\triangle Y}{Y}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Error in a physical quantity that involves powers is also calculated using
 the product rules, for example if
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=A^{2}=A\times A
\]

\end_inset

we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\triangle Z}{Z}=2\frac{\triangle A}{A}
\]

\end_inset

or in general if 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=A^{n}$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\triangle Z}{Z}=n\frac{\triangle A}{A}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Vectors and scalars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In physics we come across many different measureable quantities.
 It is observed that some quantities are plain additive for example if we
 have 1 lt of water in one pot and 2 lt in another pot, then combining them
 we get 
\begin_inset Formula $1+2=3$
\end_inset

 lt of water.
 Likewise in physics some quantities can be added like numbers called scalars
 whereas others require special method for addition (or subtraction); these
 are known as vectors.
 Scalars are all those physical quantities whose measurement means only
 its value which is a number (with proper unit).
 Examples are temperature, pressure, volume, position, speed etc.
 Vectors are all those quantities whose measurement means not only its value
 but also its direction in space.
 The measurement of direction is a necessity in order to carry out operations
 (such as addition multiplication etc) on the physical quantity.
 Although it is possible to formulate the laws of physics without introducing
 the ideas of vectors; the laws of physics take a simple and beautiful form
 when written in vector notation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an example where we walk; starting from a certain point and reaching
 a destination.
 The amount by which we travelled can be calculated in two different ways.
 Firstly we can calculate the total distance covered without considering
 the direction in which we travel or secondly we could only calculate the
 shortest distance that we travel from the start to the end point.
 The amount of travel defined in the first case is known as the path length.
 It is the total distance travelled between the initial and final position
 along the actual path of motion.
 Whereas the travel defined in the second case is known as displacement.
 Displacement can be defined as the shortest path between the initial and
 final points.
 This shortest path is a straight line in cartesian system (Euclidean geometry).
 Consider an ant that starts moving from position 1 towards east and reaches
 at 5 then turns back moving 2 steps towards west.
 In this case the path length covered by the ant is 6 whereas the displacement
 moved by the ant is only 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extending the previous example in two dimensions consider displacement of
 a particle.
 Suppose a particle starts from a point and moves 20 m to the east and then
 turns 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\text{o}}$
\end_inset

 towards north and travels further by 30 m.
 The displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final
 points.

From the Pythagoras theorem we can calculate the displacement to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{20^{2}+30^{2}}=36$
\end_inset

 m, whereas the total distance (path length) travelled by the particle is
 50 m.
 Thus displacement the way it is defined does not follow the usual rules
 of addition.
 All such physical quantities which are added like the displacement are
 termed as vector quantities.
 Thus we take displacement as a physical quantity which defines vectors.

Representation of vectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We often draw vector quantities on a ruled (graph) paper as directed line
 segments, where the length of the line segement is proportional to its
 magnitude and the direction is represented on paper by showing a pointed
 arrow.
 The starting point of the segment is known as the tail of the vector and
 the pointed arrow is known as the head.

\begin_layout Subsection
Unit vector and resolution of vectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A unit vector iwith a unit magnitude is known as a unit vector.
 If we divide any vector with its magnitude we het a unit vector along its
 direction.
 A unit vector is often represented by drawing a 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

tikz 
\backslash
draw (0,0) -- (0.15,1ex) -- (0.3,0);
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (known as cap or hat or carat) above the vector.
 For example a unit vector in the direction of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{A}}$
\end_inset

 and also
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\boldsymbol{A}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{A}}{\left|\boldsymbol{A}\right|}.
\]

\end_inset

 Unit vectors along cartesian axes are the most useful set of unit vectors.
 The unit vectors along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{j}$
\end_inset

 ank 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k.}$
\end_inset

 Thus by defining unit vectors along the cartesian axes, it is possible
 to write any vector as a sum of vectors along the cartesian axes by taking
 the tail of the vector onto the origin of the coordinate system and noting
 down the coordinates of the head of the vector.
 Consider the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$

We can write the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$
\end_inset

 as a sum of two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}_{x}$
\end_inset

(which is along 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}_{y}$
\end_inset

(which is along 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis) as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}=\vec{A}_{x}+\vec{A}_{y};
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}_{y}$
\end_inset

 are the component vectors along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axes respectively.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{j}$
\end_inset

 are the unit vectors along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axes directions we can as well write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}_{x}=3\hat{i}\ \text{and}\ \vec{A}_{y}=4\hat{j}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

since the coordinates of the tip are 
\begin_inset Formula $(3,4).$
\end_inset

 Thus we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}=A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Using the parallelogram law of vector addition we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}A^{2} & =A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}+2A_{x}A_{y}\cos90^{\mathrm{o}}\\
A^{2} & =A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}
\end{aligned}
.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In general for a 3D vector we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}=A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}+A_{z}\hat{k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and

A^{2}=A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}+A_{z}^{2}.

\begin_layout Standard
The product of vectors is also defined in a special way.
 In fact there are two types of vector multiplications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Dot product or scalar product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we have two vectors say 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset

 then the dot product or scalar product between the two is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\left|\vec{A}\right|\left|\vec{B}\right|\cos\theta=AB\cos\theta
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the smaller angle between the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset

.
 The scalar product is so called because it gives a number from the multiplicati
on of vectors.
 Geometrically scalar product is the product of the length of one vector
 and the coponent of the other vector in the direction of the first vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unit vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{j,}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 satisfy the following properties 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{i}\cdot\hat{i}=\left|\hat{i}\right|\left|\hat{i}\right|\cos0^{\mathrm{o}}=1=\hat{j}\cdot\hat{j}=\hat{k}\cdot\hat{k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

also
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{i}\cdot\hat{j}=\left|\hat{i}\right|\left|\hat{j}\right|\cos90^{\mathrm{o}}=0=\hat{j}\cdot\hat{k}=\hat{k}\cdot\hat{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Using these identitities we can obtain the scalar product of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}=A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}+A_{z}\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}=B_{x}\hat{i}+B_{y}\hat{j}+B_{z}\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} & = & (A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}+A_{z}\hat{k})\cdot(B_{x}\hat{i}+B_{y}\hat{j}+B_{z}\hat{k})\nonumber \\
\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} & = & A_{x}B_{x}+A_{y}B_{y}+A_{z}B_{z}.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Thus we can obtain the angle between vectors using the following relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\cos\theta & = & \frac{\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}}{\left|\vec{A}\right|\left|\vec{B}\right|}\\
\cos\theta & = & \frac{A_{x}B_{x}+A_{y}B_{y}+A_{z}B_{z}}{\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}+A_{z}^{2}}\,\,\sqrt{B_{x}^{2}+B_{y}^{2}+B_{z}^{2}}}.

\begin_layout Standard
The vector product between two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset

 is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=\left|\vec{A}\right|\left|\vec{B}\right|\sin\theta=AB\sin\theta\vec{n}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the cross product results into another vector it also has a direction.
 The direction can be found by rotating a right had screw from the first
 vector to the second vector through the smaller angle, and the direction
 of the advance of the screw is the direction of the vector formed through
 the crosss product.
 Thus the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

 is perpendicular to the plane formed by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset

 in this case in the upward direction.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}\times\vec{A}$
\end_inset

 points exactly opposite to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}\times\vec{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=-\vec{B}\times\vec{A}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Geometrically the magnitude of the cross product gives the area of the
 parallelogram formed by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B.}$
\end_inset

Using this convection for the direction of the cross product, it is easy
 to verify the following identities
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{i}\times\hat{i}=\hat{j}\times\hat{j}=\hat{k}\times\hat{k}=0\,\,\text{since}\,\,\sin90^{\mathrm{o}}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{i}\times\hat{j}=\hat{k},\,\,\hat{j}\times\hat{k}=\hat{i},\,\,\hat{k}\times\hat{i}=\hat{j}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

also
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{j}\times\hat{i}=-\hat{k},\,\,\hat{k}\times\hat{j}=-\hat{i},\,\,\hat{i}\times\hat{k}=-\hat{j}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Using these identities it is straight forward to verify that for two vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{A}=A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}+A_{z}\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}=B_{x}\hat{i}+B_{y}\hat{j}+B_{z}\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} & = & (A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}+A_{z}\hat{k})\times(B_{x}\hat{i}+B_{y}\hat{j}+B_{z}\hat{k})\nonumber \\
\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} & = & \hat{i}\left(A_{y}B_{z}-A_{z}B_{y}\right)-\hat{j}\left(A_{x}B_{z}-A_{z}B_{x}\right)\nonumber \\
 &  & +\hat{k}\left(A_{x}B_{y}-A_{y}B_{x}\right).
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The cross product can be written in short as a determinant, thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=\left|\begin{array}{ccc}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k}\\
A_{x} & A_{y} & A_{z}\\
B_{x} & B_{y} & B_{z}
\end{array}\right|.

A frame of reference in which Newton's 1st law is valid is called an inertial
 frame of reference.
 And a frame in which Newton's 1st law is not valid is called a non-inertial

 Earth for most practical purposes can be considered as an inertial frame

 Further all frames moving uniformly(constant velocity) with respect to
 an inertial frame are themselves inertial.

\begin_layout Standard
When dealing with an event(in a physical problem), if the formula for

 However one can predict the motion of an object in future (or in past)
 if formula for

 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is therefore also known as equation of motion.
 Since it is a vector equation we can write
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

Uniform circular motion-centripetal force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often we come across examples of motion in which an object revolves in circular
 path around a point called the center.
 A merry-go-round, a stone tied to a string when revolved, a fan rotating
 around its axis, the earth revolving around sun or the moon revolving around
 earth, an electron revolving around nucleus are all examples of motion
 known as circular motion.
 Circular motion is only possible if there exists a force that binds the
 object towards the center; such a force is therefore called the centripetal
 force.
 In uniform circular motion the speed of object remains constant while its
 direction keeps on changing; hence it is an accelerated motion, the correspondi
ng acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.
 Centripetal force is not a new kind of force but is just a term given in
 reference to uniform circular motion.
 The centripetal force can be any of the fundamental or non-fundamental
 forces.
 For example in the case of a stone tied to string, the force that keeps
 the stone in its path is the tension force; hence tension is the centripetal
 force in this case.
 In the case of earth revolving around sun, the centripetal force is the
 gravitational force between the sun and the earth.
 In the case of the electron it is the electromagnetic force which binds
 it to the nucleus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the centripetal force is due to gravity we have the Newton's law of gravitati
on.
 If it is electromagnetic force we have the Coulomb's law.
 But in most cases it may not be possible to find an exact formula for centripet
al force.
 But one can still calculate the value of centripetal force based on the
 dynamics of the object that revolves.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a particle revolving anti-clockwise on a circular trajectory with
 respect to a certain origin with linear speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

.
 Consider the origin O of xy coordinate system to be situated at the center
 of the particles path.
 The position of the particle can be given by the values of the radius and
 the angle it makes with the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis.
 These are known as the polar coordinates.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 be the radius of the circular path and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 be the mass of the object.
 Let at any instant 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 the particle be situated at point P as shown in the diagram.
 After some time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle t$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\triangle t$
\end_inset

) the particle arrives at point 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Then the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\angle POQ=\triangle\theta$
\end_inset

 is known as the average angular displacement of the particle.
 The angle covered in unit time is known as the angular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega=\frac{\text{angle}}{\text{time}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this case the angle covered is 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\theta$
\end_inset

 and the time taken is 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega=\frac{\triangle\theta}{\triangle t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is the average angular velocity.
 The time required to complete one rotation is known as the time period
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 And in one time period the particle traces a complete circle which is an
 angle of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi.$
\end_inset

 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f;
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is known as the frequency of revolutions.
 The frequency is the number of times the particle revolves in 1 s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the geometry of the diagram one can easily verify that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\triangle\theta=\frac{\triangle S}{r}
\]

\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\omega & =\frac{1}{r}\frac{\triangle S}{\triangle t}\\
\omega & =\frac{v}{r}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=r\omega.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The above equation gives the relationship between linear and angular speed.
 Making use of this relationship we can write the centripetal acceleration
 eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:centeri_acceleratio"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=\omega^{2}r
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the centripetal force eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:centri_force"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F=m\omega^{2}r.
\]

\end_inset

 The angular acceleration is defined as the change in angular velocity per
 unit change in time, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\frac{\triangle\omega}{\triangle t}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In uniform circular motion there is no change in angular speed and thus
 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\omega=0$
\end_inset

 giving 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

.
 The angular acceleration can be related to the linear acceelration as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\alpha & =\frac{1}{r}\frac{\triangle v}{\triangle t}\\
\alpha & =\frac{a}{r}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=r\alpha.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position vector 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is always directed towards the particle along the radius while the force
 is directed towards the center.
 Thus taking directions into account we can write force equatoin as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F=-m\omega^{2}r.
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is constant in uniform circular motion we can define 
\begin_inset Formula $m\omega^{2}=k$
\end_inset

 as another constant giving,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F=-kr
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=-kr\label{eq:shmeq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This is known as a linear restoring force, and it leads to a kind of periodic
 motion known as simple harmonic motion
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

\begin_layout Standard
The uniform circular motion is an example of periodic motion.
 Periodic motion is a motion in which the body moves along a path which
 constinuously repeats after a fixed interval of time.
 This path can be linear or circular.
 We come across many such examples of periodic motion in daily life.
 A pendulum of clock swings back and forth, a boat anchored at the shore
 jumps up and down in water, motion of needle of sewing machine, wheels
 of bicycles turning or fan blowing air etc are some common examples.
 By repeatition of motion means the body assumes the same values of position
 and velocity after the fixed interval of time.
 The fixed interval of time after which the body repeats its motion (has
 same position and velocity) is known as time period or periodic time denoted
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The peiodic motion is also known as an oscillation or vibration.
 Thus the periodic time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 can also be defined as the time required to complete one oscillation or
 vibration.
 The number of times the body repeats its motion or the number of oscillations
 executed by the body in 1 s is known as the frequency of oscillations and
 the symbol used for frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and its unit is Hz.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general the periodic motion can be quite complicated, but a periodic
 motion known as the Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is encountered frequently
 and is well understood mathematically.
 Whenever a body executes periodic motion under the action of an acceleration
 that is proportional to displacement but is always oppositely directed
 to it, the motion is known as SHM.
 Thus for SHM
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a\propto-x.\label{eq:shm_projeq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The SHM can be understood as the projection of uniform circular motion onto
 any one of the diameters.
 As can be seen from the diagram 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SHM-projection"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the displacement of projection onto 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=A\cos\omega t\,\,\,\,y=A\sin\omega t.\label{eq:shmsolu}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The particle completes one revolution in time period 
\begin_inset Formula $T.$
\end_inset

 So each quadrant is covered in a time of 
\begin_inset Formula $T/4$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the position of the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 coordinates are,

 is called the universal gravitational constant.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 does not change from place to place or from planet to planet and it even
 does not depend on the medium between the bodies.
 Due to the smallness of gravitational force the value of

 The force of gravity is only attractive, part of the reason for which is
 that there exists only one kind of mass (which is considered positive by

If we consider earth to be a sphere of uniform density then the entire mass

Electromagnetic force

Next to the gravitational force the effects of the force which are most
 easily observed is the electromagnetic force.
 In fact the electromagnetic force is actually about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{35}$
\end_inset

 times or more stronger than the gravitational force.
 Both electric and magnetic forces are a result of charges.
 Thus charge is the source of electric (and magnetic) force.
 Systematic study of electric and magnetic forces was carried out by several
 people; most notably Coulomb, Ampere, Faraday, Biot and Savart and their
 unification was carried out by Maxwell.

\begin_layout Subsection
Strong and weak nuclear forces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strongest of all fundamental force is commonly referred to as the Strong
 force.
 It is responsible for binding the nucleus together.
 In fact the force that exists between protons and neutrons (not due to
 their electric charge) is called the Strong force.
 The strong force is a result of different kinds of charge called color
 charge.
 Unlike electric charge color charge exists in three flavors (red green
 and blue) and exists on smaller particles (smaller than nucleons) called
 quarks.
 Proton and neutron are made up of quarks.
 The strong force/interaction can be considered as a residual force of color
 charges.
 The strong force is attractive for distances up-to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-15}$
\end_inset

 m and becomes very small beyond that.
 This short range property is called saturation.
 The strong force is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic forces.
 The effects of the strong force is only observable within the nucleus(
 and some other particles known as hadrons), therefore in day to day life
 we have not encountered it directly.
 The initial systematic theoretical study of the strong force was carried
 out by Yukawa and he concluded that the force is not an inverse square
 law such as the gravity or the electromagnetic forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand the weak force is a different type of force which is a
 result of electromagnetic forces but acts up-to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-18}$
\end_inset

 m.
 Hence this type of force is only observable in high energy experiments
 with protons and neutrons.
 The weak force is about 10,000 times weaker than the electromagnetic forces.
 The weak force/interaction is responsible for several observable phenomena
 such as beta decay.
 Further it is crucial to the structure of the universe since the sun would
 not burn without the beta decay(
\begin_inset Formula $p\to n$
\end_inset

) and the formation of heavier nuclei.

Some useful non-fundamental forces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We experience many kinds of forces in day to day life.
 All these forces are a result of the fundamental forces that we saw.
 However most forces are a result of just the electromagnetic force in one
 way or the other.
 For these forces usually a fundamental formula does not exist, however
 one can find an operational formula (one that can be used for practical
 calculations) based on experiments and events involved.
 Here we review some of the most useful forces that occur during the course
 of mechanics.

 one block is kept on the other block which is kept on ground.
 Due to the gravitational force of the earth the upper block pushes the
 lower block towards the center of the earth.
 But as a common observation we find that the upper block remains at rest.
 This is only possible if there is another force exerted by the lower block
 on to the upper block which exactly balances the downward gravitational
 pull.
 This force is often called the Normal Force or the Normal Reaction.
 This force is a result of contact between bodies and arises due to the
 complicated electromagnetic interactions that take place between the bodies
 at the contact surface.
 The normal reaction is always perpendicular to the surface of the bodies
 hence the name normal.
 There are several symbols used in literature for normal reaction, most
 notably 
\begin_inset Formula $N,\,\,F_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

The tension force is the force that is transmitted through a string, rope,
 cable or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends.
 It is directed along the length of the wire and pulls equally on the objects
 on the opposite ends of the wire.
 Tension force is again a result of electromagnetic forces.
 Commonly used symbol for tension force is 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The tension force is bi-directional along the length and acts to balance
 the external force.
 In the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 if the sphere of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is at rest then 
\begin_inset Formula $T=mg$
\end_inset

.
 However the value of tension force depends upon the elastic properties
 of the material of the string/rope or cables.
 In most cases these elastic properties balance the applied external force
 if however the external force is large in such cases the tension may not
 be able to balance and the string/rope can break.

The spring force is the force exerted by a compressed or stretched spring
 upon any object that is attached to it.
 An object that compresses or stretches a spring is always acted upon by
 a force that restores the object to its rest or equilibrium position.
 The spring force is also a result of electromagnetic forces between molecules
 of the spring.
 The spring froce is given by Hooke's law.
 According to Hooke's law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
the magnitude of the spring force is directly proportional to the amount
 of stretch or compression of the spring and is always directed oppositie
 to the direction of displacement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In symbols if 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 denotes the spring force and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 denotes the extension(or compression) of the spring, then according to
 Hooke's law
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F\propto x
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=-kx;\label{eq:spring-force}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is know as the spring constant and the negative sign denotes the fact that
 the force is opposite to the displacement.
 Its unit is 
\begin_inset Formula $N/m$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 denotes the stiffness of spring.
 Higher 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 value spring require larger force to produce displacement.
 If the block has mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 then from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:spring-force"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we can write the acceleration of the block as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\vec{a} & =-\frac{k}{m}\vec{x}\\
\vec{a} & =-\omega^{2}\vec{x}\label{eq:shm-acceleration}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of acceleration which is proportional to displacement and always
 oppositely directed leads to a very special kind of motion known as the
 Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).
 SHM is a kind of a periodic motion.
 A In the case of the block attached to the spring the frequency of oscillations
 can be obtained by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
\]

\end_inset

Thus frequency of oscillations (how fast the block moves) depends on the
 stiffness constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and the mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:shm-acceleration"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 gives the position of the block as function of time which is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=A\cos(\omega t).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus the position is represented by the cosine function.
 Historically the sine and cosine functions frequently appeared in music
 theory and since the term harmony is related to music, these functions
 are known as harmonic functions and the kind of motion they represent is
 known as Harmonic Motion.
 In SHM the word simple means single frequency (the most basic) harmonic
 motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just like the spring case, in general any force that is directly proportional
 to displacement of object and in opposite directiron to displacement is
 known as harmonic oscillator force.
 Such a force causes oscillations of the object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Friction force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The force of friction is yet another type of contact force that exists between
 surfaces in contact.
 There are three kinds friction forces that exist between solid surfaces.
 Static friction, sliding friction and rolling or kinetic friction.
 The friction force is always opposite to the direction of motion.
 Static friction tends to oppose the motion of an object kept at rest.
 It is found that the friction force directly proportional to the normal
 reaction.
 In case of static friction, the maximum or the limiting value of force
 of friction is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{S}=\mu_{S}N;
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S}$
\end_inset

 is known as coefficient of static friction.
 Once the object starts moving the friction force decreases and is known
 as sliding friction.
 The sliding friction is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{K}=\mu_{K}N;
\end{equation}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{K}$
\end_inset

 is known as coefficient of kinetic friction.
 In case of a round object rolling such as a wheel, the friction force that
 exists between the surfaces is known as rolling friction.
 The value of rolling friction is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{R}=\mu_{R}N.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In general it is found that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{S}>\mu_{K}>\mu_{R}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Friction force is a non-conservative force.
 Presence of friction causes the mechanical energy to decrease or convert
 into heat energy.

Viscosity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viscosity can be considered as a friction force that exists between fluids
 and/or fluids and solids.
 In general viscosity is a force that tends to depend upon the relative
 motion n speed of the adjacent parts of fluids.
 Such a fluid is known as viscous fluid.
 Viscosity like friction is a non-conservative force.

An arrangement of a point mass attached to a weightless inextensible string
 is known as a simple pendulum.
 In reality a small spherical ball attached to a string is taken as a simple
 pendulum.
 The sphere is called the bob of the pendulum.
 When the bob is taken to one of the sides and released it executes periodic
 motion about the central equilibrium position.

which gives

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the negative sign indicates that the acceleration of the bob is opposite

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\theta\to0}\sin\theta\simeq\theta$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a=-g\theta.

From the geometry
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta=\frac{\text{arc length}}{\text{radius}}=\frac{S}{l}=\frac{x}{l}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $S\simeq x$

Comparing this with the

 we see that the motion is approximately simple harmonic with angular frequency

The problem of satellite motion can easily be solved by making use of Newton's
 law of gravitation and centripetal force.
 Consider a satellite of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 which is to be launched at a definite height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 from the surface of the earth.
 Let mass of earth be 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and radius of earth be 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Now at this height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 the gravitational attraction due to earth must provide the centripetal
 force required to maintain the satellite in its orbit.
 In other words 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{G}=F_{C}.$
\end_inset

 If the speed of satellite is not sufficient then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{C}<F_{G}$
\end_inset

 and the satellite will fall to the surface of earth.
 If speed of satellite is more so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{C}>F_{G}$
\end_inset

, then the satellite will escape the pull of earth.
 Thus to keep it revolving at some height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 it must be made to revolve with a definite speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 which will make 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{G}=F_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus if 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the required orbital speed then at this speed we must have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{G} & = & F_{C}\\
G\frac{Mm}{(R+h)^{2}} & = & \frac{mv^{2}}{(R+h)}\\
v^{2} & = & \frac{GM}{(R+h)}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

the required speed is therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R+h}}.\label{eq:sateliite-speed}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus the satellite if launched at the required height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 must be given this speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 in order to keep it revolving in its orbit.
 We can also obtain the time period of the satellite.
 Time period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the time taken by the satellite to complete one revolution around the
 earth.
 In one revolution the distance covered by the satellite around the earth
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi(R+h)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
T & = & \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}\\
T & = & \frac{2\pi(R+h)}{v}\\
T^{2} & = & \frac{4\pi^{2}(R+h)^{2}}{v^{2}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Substituting the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sateliite-speed"

\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}(R+h)^{3}}{GM}.\label{eq:time-period}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Banking of roads

\begin_layout Standard
When a bike or car makes a turn at a road, the friction force prevents the
 bike or car from slipping off the track.
 However if the speed of the vehicle is large the friction force may not
 be sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force.
 In that case the bike may slip.
 So the maximum safe speed can be obtained easily.
 If the mass of the bike is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and the coefficient of static friction of the track is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S}$
\end_inset

 and radius of the turning arc is 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 then we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_{S}N & = & \frac{mv_{\text{safe}}^{2}}{r}\\
\mu_{S}mg & = & \frac{mv_{\text{safe}}^{2}}{r}\\
v_{\text{safe}} & = & \sqrt{\mu_{S}rg}.

The force acting on the vehicle are weight

 in the downard direction, normal force 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 perpendicular to the raod and friction force 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 parallel to the road.
 As the acceleration of vehicle perpendicular to road is zero we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
N\cos\theta & =mg+f\sin\theta
\end{align}

\end_inset

so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
mg=N\cos\theta-f\sin\theta.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the horizontal direction vehicle performs circular motion requiring centripet
al force, which is provided by the horizontal components of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\sin\theta+f\cos\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{R}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\text{max}}$
\end_inset

 we put 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\mu_{S}N$
\end_inset

 and we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\cos\theta=mg+\mu_{S}N\sin\theta
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\sin\theta+\mu_{S}N\cos\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{R}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N=\frac{mg}{\cos\theta-\mu_{S}\sin\theta}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Substituting value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{mg\left(\sin\theta-\mu_{S}\cos\theta\right)}{\cos\theta-\mu_{S}\sin\theta}=\frac{mv_{\text{max}}^{2}}{R}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v_{\text{max}}=\left(Rg\frac{\mu_{S}+\tan\theta}{1-\mu_{S}\tan\theta}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S}=0$
\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v_{0}=\left(Rg\tan\theta\right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

At this speed frictional force is not needed at all to provide the necessary
 centripetal force.
 Driving at this speed will cause little wear and tear to the tyres of the
 car.

\begin_layout Section
Concept of work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In physics the concepts of work and energy are extremely useful tools to
 solve many physical problems.
 A principle known as the conservation of energy is a central idea behind
 the happenings of any process in the entire universe.
 The idea of work or energy can be assumed to be developed parallel to the
 idea of force although we will begin the concept of work as a result of
 force.
 However it can be safely assumed that the conservation of energy can be
 used to effectively to predict the future of an event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a force acting on a body produces a change in its position; work
 is said to be done by the force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Work is measured by the product of the applied force and the displacement
 of the body in the direction of the force, i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{work}=\text{force}\times\text{displacement parallel to force}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Work is usually denoted with 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and if denote the distance with 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
W & =\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}\label{eq:workvectoreqn}\\
W & =Fd\cos\theta.
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the force and displacement.
 Thus work is a scalar product of force and displacement.
 The SI unit of work is 
\series bold
Joule
\series default
 written in symbol as 
\series bold
J
\series default
.
 We have
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $J=Nm$
\end_inset

.

\series default
 One can easily see that when both the displacement and force are parallel
 (or anti-parallel) the work done is maximum and when force and displacement
 are mutually perpendicular; the work done is zero.
 We later learn that positive work done increases the energy and negative
 work done decreases (dissipates) the energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work done by a constant force and constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 can be calculated with equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:workvectoreqn"

\end_inset

, but if during the course of the objects motion the work done keeps on
 changing or if the direction of the displacement keeps on changing, one
 must divide the motion into small enough segments and consider adding the
 work done during this small displacements (at which 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 may be treated constants) to calculate the total work done during the motion.
 In such a case the total work done may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\int\vec{F}\cdot\vec{dx}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $dx$
\end_inset

 denotes the small displacements in which the total displacement is broken
 into.
 Yet another way to calculate work done is through plotting the graph between
 the applied force and the displacement.
 If value of force is measured at each points of the displacement path and
 plotted on xy plane, the area covered by the force graph with the x-axis
 gives the total work done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The energy of a body is defined as its capacity of doing work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like work energy is also a scalar quantity and the dimensions are also identical
 to that of work.
 Therefore the SI unit of energy is also joule.
 In a mechanical system energy is mainly classified as being either Kinetic
 or Potential.
 Sum of Kinetic and Potential energies is called the total mechanical energy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Kinetic energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The energy possessed by a body due to its motion is called its kinetic energy.
 If an object of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is moving with a (constant) speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, then the kinetic energy possessed by the body is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\label{eq:keliner}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Just as force was related to acceleration through 
\begin_inset Formula $F=ma$
\end_inset

, so is work related to velocity through the Work-Energy Theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an object of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 acted upon by a force 
\begin_inset Formula $F.$
\end_inset

 Under the action of this force suppose the objects speed increases from
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 within a displacement of 
\begin_inset Formula $s.$
\end_inset

Then the work done (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in the same direction),
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=Fs
\]

\end_inset

where if we use 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2a}\,\,\text{and}\,\,F=ma
\]

\end_inset

we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
W & =ma\times\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2a}\\
W & =\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Or we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{\text{net}}=\Delta K=K_{f}-K_{i}=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2}\label{eq:work_energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The net work done by all the forces on a body of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the body.
 Positive work done will increase the kinetic energy whereas the negative
 work done will decrease the kinetic energy of the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conservative forces and Potential Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the idea of work, we can classify forces as conservative or non-conserv
ative.
 A conservative force is a force which conserves the total mechanical energy
 of a body.
 A body moving under conservative force does not loose energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Work done under the action of a conservative force between any two end points
 is independent of the path taken to perform the work.
 Further the net work done along a closed path is always zero for a conservative
 force.
 Examples of conservative forces are Gravitational force, Electrostatic
 and magnetic forces and spring force.
 Positive Work done on a body against these conservative forces gets stored.
 This stored form of energy is known as potential energy.
 Thus potential energy can only be defined for conservative forces.
 When a body is moved in the presence of a conservative force from one point
 to another it can be interpreted as a change in potential energy.
 Thus the change of potential energy from initial position to final position
 is defined as the negative of the work done by the conservative force or
 the positive of the work done by an external force equal in magnitude to
 the conservative force.
 Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U(f)-U(i)=-W.\label{eq:poten_energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:work_energy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:poten_energy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U(f)-U(i)=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This equation tells that the decrease in potential energy is balanced by
 an equal increase in kinetic energy and vice versa.
 This equation can be rearranged to write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2}+U(i)=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}+U(f).\label{eq:energy_cons}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is known as the conservation of energy equation.
 The sum of initial kinetic and potential energies is equal to the sum of
 final kinetic and potential energies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The form for the potential energy depends upon the conservative force in
 question.
 The following table lists some of the formulae for potential energies of
 common conservative forces.

Consider a particle of mass

 The angular momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{l}$

 of this particle about a certain orgin 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{l}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p}.

Thus

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{r}=x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k}$

 is the position vector (a vector from the origin of the co-ordinate system

Similarly if on a particle of mass

\[
\frac{\triangle\vec{l}}{\triangle t}=\vec{r}\times\frac{\triangle\vec{p}}{\triangle t}+\frac{\triangle\vec{r}}{\triangle t}\times\vec{p}

The electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces that is very
 well understood at almost all levels.
 It was known from ancient times that if we rub objects together then they
 acquire a special thing or property due to which the objects can attract
 or repel each other.
 This special thing that the objects acquired is known as charge.
 Charge will be denoted by the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and its unit is the coulomb or 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Now the property of charge must be looked as any other property of an object
 such as color, shape or even mass.
 Just like an object can possess the property of color it can possess charge.
 Now there are several key things about charge itself that we should pay
 attention to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Charge comes in two varieties
\begin_inset Newline newline

Traditionally termed positive and negative, the two types of charges lead
 to both the attractive and repulsive forces.
 Forces between like charges are repulsive whereas between opposite charges
 are attractive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Charge is conserved
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The total charge in an isolated system always remains the same.
 In other words charges cannot be created or destroyed.
 Charges can be transferred from one body to other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Charge is quantized
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When we rub two objects together it is the electrons which move from one
 object to the other.
 Now the charge on an electron is 
\begin_inset Formula $e=1.6\times10^{-19}C$
\end_inset

.
 We can only transfer whole electrons on to other objects.
 It means the total charge on an object can be a multiple of the number
 of electrons charge i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=ne$

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 is an integer.

Force between two charges-Coulomb's law

Coulomb a french engineer studied the forces between charged objects for
 several years and found a formula for the force between them.
 He measured the force to be proportional to the product of charges and
 inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
 In symbols if the charges are labeled as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$

\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k=9\times10^{9}\,Nm^{2}/C^{2}$
\end_inset

 is an experimentally measured value.
 If the value of force is positive then it denotes repuslive force and attractiv
e if negative.
 In this formula it is assumed that the charges are placed in vacuum or
 air.
 If instead we place any medium such as a paper in between the charges,
 the force between the charges reduces by some factor.
 If we denote the vacuum force by 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}$
\end_inset

 then the force in a medium may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{1}=\frac{F_{0}}{\epsilon_{r}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{r}$
\end_inset

 by which the force reduces depends upon the type of material medium placed
 between the charges.
 It is a pure number and commonly know as dielectric constant of the material.
 It is also know as the relative permittivity of the medium.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{r}=1$
\end_inset

 for air.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 can further be written in terms of another fundamental constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}=8.8\times10^{-12}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{2}/Nm^{2}$
\end_inset

as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus we get for vacuum
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{0}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and for medium 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{1}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The product 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}=\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is known as the permittivity (absolute permittivity) of the medium.
 Thus we have

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{r}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}}=\frac{F_{0}}{F_{1}}.

Electric Field

\begin_layout Standard
When we are given magnets to play with we get fascinated by the way they
 exert forces onto one another even at a distance without any contact.
 This kind of non-contact behaviour of forces used to puzzle the great minds
 of Newton and Coulomb as well, since through a number of experiments we
 have come to know that we need some kind of contact to exert forces.
 Thus it was difficult for them to understand a force without contact.
 So in order to restore the contact idea, it was thought that the charges
 do exert forces via some kind of invisible contact.
 They thought that the charges gave some invisible property to the space
 around them due to which if any other charge entered into their proximity
 will experience the force of electricity.
 This invisible property is known as the Field.
 So every charge produces its own field known as the electric field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically a field (of any charge distribution) is a function of position
 and time; i.e.
 its value changes from point to point and also with time.
 Consider a situation in which some charge is kept hidden in a box.
 If we ask a question whether a charge exists within the box or not? This
 kind of question can not be answered just by looking at the box (since
 charge does not glow).
 In order to answer this question one can bring another charge and place
 it outside the box but near the box and measure the force (if any) acting
 onto the charge.

If we find that this charge experiences some force then we can infer that
 the box contains some charge.
 In this case we can see that the charge within the box produces One can
 take the analogy of a perfume.

Electric field lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electric field lines are a convenient way to visualise the presence of fields.
 The field lines can be drawn by imagining a curve drawn along the path
 followed by a positive charge.
 Thus the field lines are imaginary curves along which a positive charge
 would tend to move if it were free to do so.
 Lets take some examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field lines are diverging (going outwards) from single positive charge
 and converging (going inwards) for a single negative charge.

\begin_layout Subsection
Electric field of a dipole
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A system of two equal but opposite charges separated by a small distance
 are known as a dipole.
 A dipole is electrically neutral yet in the proximity of a dipole the field
 of the dipole at any point may not be zero since the nearness of any one
 charge will contribute more field than the other.
 This causes certain residual field to be generated.
 The properties of this residual field are important not just for academic
 purpose but also for practical purpose since many molecules can be treated
 as dipoles to a good approximation.
 Just as value of charge denotes the strength of electric field produced
 by a single charge, in case of a dipole a related physical quantity called
 the dipole moment is of great significance.
 The symbol used for dipole moment is 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p=2aq.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Axis passing through the line joining the charges is known as the axis of
 the dipole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Axial point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine a point at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from the center of the dipole situated on the axis of the dipole, an axial
 point.
 We are interested in calculating the field produced by this dipole at this
 location.
 The net field at this point will be just the sum of the fields due to the
 positive and the negative charges.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{axial}}=E_{+q}+E_{-q}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, we can write the formulae for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{+q}$
\end_inset

 and and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{-q}$
\end_inset

 by making use of the formula of a field due to a single charge, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{+q}=\frac{kq}{\left(r-a\right)^{2}}\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,E_{-q}=\frac{kq}{\left(r+a\right)^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{axial}} & =\frac{kq}{\left(r-a\right)^{2}}-\frac{kq}{\left(r+a\right)^{2}}\\
E_{\text{axial}} & =\frac{k\left(4aq\right)r}{\left(r^{2}-a^{2}\right)^{2}}\\
E_{\text{axial}} & =k\frac{2pr}{\left(r^{2}-a^{2}\right)^{2}}\label{eq:dipole_axial}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dipole_axial"

\end_inset

 gives the value of the electric field for a dipole.
 If the point of observation lies far away from the tiny dipole i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gg a$
\end_inset

, then neglecting 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the denominator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{axial}} & =k\frac{2pr}{r^{4}}\\
E_{\text{axial}} & =k\frac{2p}{r^{3}};
\end{align}

\end_inset

the equation says that the dipole field falls off as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{3}$
\end_inset

 from the charge.

Consider now the point to be located at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 on the line passing through the center of the dipole and perperndicular
 to its axis i.e.
 its perpendicular bisector.
 Since the point of observation now lies at an eqaul distance from both
 the charges the fields of both the charges have same magnitude
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{+q}=E_{-q}=\frac{kq}{(r+a)^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

But as can be seen from the diagram; only the vertically downward components
 contribute to the total field whereas horizontal components being equal
 and opposite cancel out, thus we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{pb}} & =E_{+Q}\cos\theta+E_{-Q}\cos\theta\\
 & =2E_{+Q}\cos\theta
\end{align}

\end_inset

From the diagram we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta=\frac{a}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and so we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{pb}} & =2\frac{kq}{\left(r+a\right)^{2}}\times\frac{a}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}\\
E_{\text{pb}} & =\frac{\left(2aq\right)k}{\left(r^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\\
E_{\text{pb}} & =\frac{pk}{\left(r^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{3/2}}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

If the point of observation lies far away i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gg a$
\end_inset

 then neglecting 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}$
\end_inset

 in above equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{\text{pb}}=\frac{pk}{r^{3}}.

\begin_layout Section
Electrostatic potential energy and potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Till now the discussion has been based on the idea of force and field (force
 per unit charge).
 In mechanics we had an alternative but equivalent approach based on energy
 that allowed us to solve many problems without going into complicated calculati
ons involving forces.
 The electric force is also a conservative force.
 Therefore a natural question arises that if we have a collection of charges
 then what is the potential energy associated with it.
 This can be calculated by just calculating the work required to assemble
 the collection of charges.
 Let us start with the simplest configuration of collection of charges i.e.
 a pair of charges.
 Suppose we have two positive charges 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We shall treat the charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 as the source charge and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the test charge.
 Suppose initially the test charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 is at a distance of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 from the source charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and we want to bring it closer and place it at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For this we will have to do some work against the electric force of repulsion.
 The work done is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=F\times d\label{eq:workdoneele}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

now here we can write for the displacement 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d=y-x
\end{equation}

\end_inset

.
 But the value of force changes on the entire path.
 For example the value of forces at the intial and final points are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{x}=\frac{kqq_{1}}{x^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{y}=\frac{kqq_{1}}{y^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

So which of these should we use in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:workdoneele"

\end_inset

.
 The thing is that we have to take some kind of average of these two values.
 In this case since the force changes as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{2}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 as a geometric progression we can take a geometric average of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{y}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
F & =\sqrt{F_{x}F_{y}}\\
 & =\frac{kqq_{1}}{xy}
\end{align}

\end_inset

, and we have for 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:workdoneele"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
W & =\frac{kqq_{1}}{xy}\cdot\left(y-x\right)\\
W & =kqq_{1}\left(\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}\right)
\end{align}

\end_inset

This work done equals the change in potential energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\Delta U=U_{x}-U_{y}=kqq_{1}\left(\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus we can write for the potential energy of the system of source charge
 and test charge separated by distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U=\frac{kqq_{1}}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the potential energy it is easy to define potential.
 The potential at a point located at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 due to a single source charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is obtained by calculating the work done in bringing a unit positive (test)
 charge from infinity and placing it at 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 In other words it is the potential energy per unit charge, thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{W}{q_{1}}=\frac{U}{q_{1}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus for a single (source) charge the potential at any distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{kq}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Unlike electric field potential is a scalar quantity.
 Its value is positive for a positive source charge and negative for a negative
 source charge.
 When we have a collection of charges the potential at a point is just the
 algebraic sum of potentials due to individual charges at respective distances.

Flux, Gauss' law and its applications

The flux of an electric field through any surface area is the number of
 field lines that pass through the area.
 If we have a closed surface that encloses a volume, then the total flux
 is the number of field lines entering minus the number of field lines leaving
 the surface.
 The field lines entering is the influx whereas those leaving is the out
 flux.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula

\text{flux}=\text{in flux}-\text{out flux}

The flow of charge from one point to the other is termed as electric current.
 Charges can be put in motion by creating a potential difference or voltage.
 Traditionally the motion of charges from higher potential(voltage) to lower
 potential(voltage) is termed as current and it is due to the movement of
 positive charges.
 However in actual circuits current is due to the motion of negatively charged
 electrons from lower potential to higher potential.
 In general only conductors allow for easy movement of charges due to the
 presence of fee electrons.
 Thus if we apply some potential difference across the ends of a conductor
 then current through the conductor is defined as the amount of (positive)
 charges that flow about a cross section in unit time,

EMF of a cell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The electromotive force or EMF of a cell is defined as the work done by
 the cell on to the charges to create a potential difference across its
 plates.
 It is numerically equal to the voltage across the plates of a cell when
 no current flows through it.
 Its unit is the same as that of potential difference i.e.

\begin_layout Standard
Ohm's law is a relationship between the current flowing through a conductor
 and the voltage applied across its ends.
 It states that

At constant temperature, the current passing through a conductor is directly
 proportional to the voltage applied across its ends

Resistivity

\begin_layout Standard
Resistance of a conductor depends on various factors including temperature.
 It is found that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\propto l\,\,\text{length of conductor}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\propto\frac{1}{A}\,\,\text{area of conductor}.
\]

\end_inset

 Thus we can write the resistance of the conductor as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=\rho\frac{l}{A}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is known as the resistivity of a conductor.
