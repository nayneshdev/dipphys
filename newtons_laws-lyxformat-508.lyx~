\begin_layout Section
SI units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physics is a natural science.
 One of the key objectives of physics is to predict the future or outcome
 of events.
 It is a known fact that the laws of nature can be discovered and put up
 as simple relations of formulae using the language of Mathematics.
 The process of discovery of laws follows the steps of observation, measurements
 and finding the patterns.
 The repeating pattern itself become the laws.
 This can be termed as the scientific method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key step in any natural science is the idea of measurement.
 When we want to describe a phenomena or an event, it usually involves descripti
on of a physical quantity in terms of a number and the number is obtained
 through the process of measurement.
 For example if we want to describe a room, we could give its length, breadth
 and height, all of which will require measurements of length.
 In measurement we compare the physical quantity with a given standard size
 of the physical quantity which we call the unit of that physical quantity.
 In the measurement of the length of room we compare the length with the
 standard size-metre of the length and if we find that the room is 20 m
 long only means that the standard metre is contained 20 times in the total
 length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In nature we find that there are only a certain minimum number of quantities
 that we need to measure, all the rest can be described in terms of this
 minimum set of physical quantities.
 These are traditionally called the fundamental physical quantities and
 the units of these fundamental quantities are called fundamental or base
 units.
 In old times only length, mass and time were considered as fundamental
 and various countries and kings followed different sets of units for these.
 This often led to confusions and sometimes also critical accidents when
 not properly converted from one set of units to the other.
 In SI system of units there are seven quantities defined as the fundamental
 or base quantities.

\begin_layout Standard
All the quantities which are obtained as some combination of the base quantities
 are known as the derived quantities.
 Examples of derived quantities are force, velocity, acceleration, pressure,
 energy etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Uncertainty/Errors in measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete statement of a measured value should include an estimate of
 the level of confidence associated with the value.
 Properly reporting an experimental result along with its uncertainty allows
 other people to make judgments about the quality of the experiment and
 it facilitates meaningful comparisons with other similar values or a theoretica
l prediction.
 Without an estimated uncertainty, it would be impossible to answer the
 basic scientific questions such as: “Does my result agree with theoretical
 prediction or results from other experiments?” This question is fundamental
 for deciding if a scientific hypothesis is to be confirmed or refuted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we make a measurement, it is generally assumed that there exists a
 true value for any physical quantity being measured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement.
 In general, the errors in measurement can be broadly classified as (a)
 systematic errors and (b) random errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Systematic errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The systematic errors are those errors that tend to be in one direction,
 either positive or negative.
 Some of the sources of systematic errors are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instrumental errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
that arise from the errors due to imperfect design or calibration of the
 measuring instrument, zero error in the instrument, etc.
 For example, the temperature graduations of a thermometer may be inadequately
 calibrated (it may read 104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP whereas
 it should read 100 °C); in a vernier callipers the zero mark of vernier
 scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale, or simply
 an ordinary metre scale may be worn off at one end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the temperature of a human body, a thermometer placed under
 the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of
 the body temperature.
 Other external conditions (such as changes in temperature, humidity, wind
 velocity, etc.) during the experiment may systematically affect the measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Personal errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
that arise due to an individual’s bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus
 or individual’s carelessness in taking observations without observing proper
 precautions, etc.
 For example, if you, by habit, always hold your head a bit too far to the
 right while reading the position of a needle on the scale, you will introduce
 an error due to parallax.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Systematic errors can be minimised by improving experimental techniques,
 selecting better instruments and removing personal bias as far as possible.
 For a given set-up, these errors may be estimated to a certain extent and
 the necessary corrections may be applied to the readings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Random errors 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The random 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
errors are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are random with
 respect to sign and size.
 These can arise due to random and unpredictable fluctuations in experimental
 conditions (e.g.
 unpredictable fluctuations in temperature, voltage supply, mechanical vibration
s of experimental set-ups, etc), personal (unbiased) errors by the observer
 taking readings, etc.
 For example, when the same person repeats the same observation, it is very
 likely that he may get different readings everytime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimation of errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all sources of systematic uncertainties have been identified and reduced
 to a negligible level, statistical theory says that the mean is the best
 estimation to the true value.
 In formal mathematical terms, the mean value x of a set of N measurements
 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{N}}{N}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the summation sign 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is the shorthand notation indicating the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{N}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Absolute and mean absolute error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnitude of the difference between the individual measurement and the
 true value of the quantity is called the absolute error of the measurement.
 This is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 In absence of any other method of knowing true value, we considered arithmatic
 mean as the true value.
 Then the errors in the individual measurement values from the true value,
 are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Delta x_{1} & =x_{1}-\bar{x},\\
\Delta x_{2} & =x_{2}-\bar{x},\\
\ldots & \ldots\\
\Delta x_{n} & =x_{n}-\bar{x}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is taken as the final or
 mean absolute error of the value of the physical quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 It is represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{\text{mean}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\overline{\Delta x} & =\frac{\left|\Delta x_{1}\right|+\left|\Delta x_{2}\right|+\ldots+\left|\Delta x_{n}\right|}{n}\nonumber \\
\overline{\Delta x} & =\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left|\Delta x_{n}\right|}{n}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Relative and percentage error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative error is the ratio of the mean absolute error 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

 to the mean value 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

 of the quantity measured.
 Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{Relative error}=\frac{\overline{\Delta x}}{\bar{x}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the percentage error is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta x=\left(\frac{\overline{\Delta x}}{\bar{x}}\right)\times100\%
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Propagation/Combination of errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a physical quantity defined as a combination of other physical quantities,
 the error in the measurement of that physical quantity will be calculated
 based on the errors of all of the physical quantities on which it depends.
 The rules for combining errors are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Errors in addition and subtraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a physical quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 appears as the sum or difference of other physical quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=X\pm Y
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 yield the values 
\begin_inset Formula $X\pm\triangle X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\pm\Delta Y$
\end_inset

 then the error in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\triangle Z=\triangle X+\triangle Y.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Errors in multiplication and division
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a physical quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 appears as the product or division of other physical quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=X\times Y\,\,\,\text{OR}\,\,\,X/Y
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 yield the values 
\begin_inset Formula $X\pm\triangle X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\pm\Delta Y$
\end_inset

 then the fractional error in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\triangle Z}{Z}=\frac{\triangle X}{X}+\frac{\triangle Y}{Y}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Error in a physical quantity that involves powers is also calculated using
 the product rules, for example if
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=A^{2}=A\times A
\]

\end_inset

we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\triangle Z}{Z}=2\frac{\triangle A}{A}
\]

\end_inset

or in general if 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=A^{n}$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\triangle Z}{Z}=n\frac{\triangle A}{A}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Vectors and scalars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In physics we come across many different measureable quantities.
 It is observed that some quantities are plain additive for example if we
 have 1 lt of water in one pot and 2 lt in another pot, then combining them
 we get 
\begin_inset Formula $1+2=3$
\end_inset

 lt of water.
 However this is not true in many other cases such as for example 1 banana
 and 2 apples do not equal to 3 bananas or 3 apples due to the nature of
 the fruites being different.
 Likewise in physics some quantities can be added like numbers called scalars
 whereas others require special method for addition (or subtraction); these
 are known as vectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scalars are all those physical quantities whose measurement means only its
 value which is a number (with proper unit).
 Examples are temperature, pressure, volume, position, speed etc.
 Vectors are all those quantities whose measurement means not only its value
 but also its direction in space.
 The measurement of direction is a necessity in order to carry out operations
 (such as addition multiplication etc) on the physical quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example consider displacement of a particle.
 Suppose a particle starts from a point and moves 20 m to the east and then
 turns 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\text{o}}$
\end_inset

 and travels further by 30 m.
 The displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final
 points.

From the Pythagoras theorem we can calculate the displacement to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{20^{2}+30^{2}}=36$
\end_inset

 m, whereas the total distance travelled by the particle is 50 m.
 Thus displacement the way it is defined does not follow the usual rules
 of addition.
 All such physical quantities which are added like the displacement are
 termed as vector quantities.
 Thus we take displacement as a physical quantity which defines vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We often draw vector quantities on a ruled (graph) paper as directed line
 segments, where the length of the line segement is proportional to its
 magnitude and the direction is represented on paper by showing a pointed
 arrow.
 The starting point of the segment is known as the tail of vector and the
 pointed arrow is known as the head.

Mathematically;
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{a}=0\,\,\,\,\Leftrightarrow\,\,\,\,\vec{F}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Concept of rest, motion and acceleration requires specification of frame
 of reference.
 Acceleration can be different in different frames of reference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A frame of reference is a place from where measurements are made using different
 instruments such as a metre scale and a clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A frame of reference in which Newton's 1st law is valid is called an inertial
 frame of reference.
 And a frame in which Newton's 1st law is not valid is called a non-inertial
 frame of reference.
 Earth for most practical purposes can be considered as an inertial frame
 of reference.
 Further all frames moving uniformly(constant velocity) with respect to
 an inertial frame are themselves inertial.
 Thus a train moving with uniform velocity w.r.t.
 ground, plane moving with uniform velocity w.r.t.
 highway are examples of inertial frames.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When dealing with an event(in a physical problem), if the formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F}$
\end_inset

 is not known one can find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F}$
\end_inset

 by measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{a}$
\end_inset

 However one can predict the motion of an object in future (or in past)
 if formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{F}$
\end_inset

 is known.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:2ndlaw"

\end_inset

 is therefore also known as equation of motion.
 Since it is a vector equation we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}=F_{x}\hat{i}+F_{y}\hat{j}+F_{z}\hat{k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{a}=a_{x}\hat{i}+a_{y}\hat{j}+a_{z}\hat{k}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{p}=p_{x}\hat{i}+p_{y}\hat{j}+p_{z}\hat{k}

Whenever a body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts on
 the first body a force equal in magnitude but in the opposite direction.
 Forces always occur in pairs.
 Thus

There is no cuase-effect relationship i.e.

 times or more stronger than the gravitational force.
 Both electric and magnetic forces are a result of charges.
 Thus charge is the source of electric (and magnetic) force.
 Systematic study of electric and magnetic forces was carried out by several

Strong and weak nuclear forces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strongest of all fundamental force is commonly referred to as the Strong
 force.
 It is responsible for binding the nucleus together.
 In fact the force that exists between protons and neutrons (not due to
 their electric charge) is called the Strong force.
 The strong force is a result of different kinds of charge called color
 charge.
 Unlike electric charge color charge exists in three flavors (red green
 and blue) and exists on smaller particles (smaller than nucleons) called
 quarks.
 Proton and neutron are made up of quarks.
 The strong force/interaction can be considered as a residual force of color
 charges.
 The strong force is attractive for distances up-to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-15}$
\end_inset

 m and becomes very small beyond that.
 This short range property is called saturation.
 The strong force is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic forces.
 The effects of the strong force is only observable within the nucleus(
 and some other particles known as hadrons), therefore in day to day life
 we have not encountered it directly.
 The initial systematic theoretical study of the strong force was carried
 out by Yukawa and he concluded that the force is not an inverse square
 law such as the gravity or the electromagnetic forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand the weak force is a different type of force which is a
 result of electromagnetic forces but acts up-to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-18}$
\end_inset

 m.
 Hence this type of force is only observable in high energy experiments
 with protons and neutrons.
 The weak force is about 10,000 times weaker than the electromagnetic forces.
 The weak force/interaction is responsible for several observable phenomena
 such as beta decay.
 Further it is crucial to the structure of the universe since the sun would
 not burn without the beta decay(
\begin_inset Formula $p\to n$

) and the formation of heavier nuclei.

Some useful non-fundamental forces
\end_layout

We experience many kinds of forces in day to day life.
 All these forces are a result of the fundamental forces that we saw.
 However most forces are a result of just the electromagnetic force in one
 way or the other.
 For these forces usually a fundamental formula does not exist, however
 one can find an operational formula (one that can be used for practical
 calculations) based on experiments and events involved.
 Here we review some of the most useful forces that occur during the course

When two bodies are pressed against each other, they exert forces on each
 other.
 In figure

\end_inset

 one block is kept on the other block which is kept on ground.
 Due to the gravitational force of the earth the upper block pushes the
 lower block towards the center of the earth.
 But as a common observation we find that the upper block remains at rest.
 This is only possible if there is another force exerted by the lower block
 on to the upper block which exactly balances the downward gravitational
 pull.
 This force is often called the Normal Force or the Normal Reaction.
 This force is a result of contact between bodies and arises due to the
 complicated electromagnetic interactions that take place between the bodies
 at the contact surface.
 The normal reaction is always perpendicular to the surface of the bodies
 hence the name normal.
 There are several symbols used in literature for normal reaction, most
 notably 
\begin_inset Formula $N,\,\,F_{N}$

 and

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The tension force is the force that is transmitted through a string, rope,
 cable or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends.
 It is directed along the length of the wire and pulls equally on the objects
 on the opposite ends of the wire.
 Tension force is again a result of electromagnetic forces.
 Commonly used symbol for tension force is 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The tension force is bi-directional along the length and acts to balance
 the external force.
 In the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tension-force"

\end_inset

 if the sphere of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is at rest then 
\begin_inset Formula $T=mg$
\end_inset

.
 However the value of tension force depends upon the elastic properties
 of the material of the string/rope or cables.
 In most cases these elastic properties balance the applied external force
 if however the external force is large in such cases the tension may not
 be able to balance and the string/rope can break.

The spring force is the force exerted by a compressed or stretched spring
 upon any object that is attached to it.
 An object that compresses or stretches a spring is always acted upon by
 a force that restores the object to its rest or equilibrium position.
 The spring force is also a result of electromagnetic forces between molecules
 of the spring.
 The spring froce is given by Hooke's law.
 According to Hooke's law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
the magnitude of the spring force is directly proportional to the amount
 of stretch or compression of the spring and is always directed oppositie
 to the direction of displacement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In symbols if 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 denotes the spring force and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 denotes the extension(or compression) of the spring, then according to
 Hooke's law
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F\propto x
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=kx;
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is know as the spring constant.
 Its unit is 
\begin_inset Formula $N/m$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 denotes the stiffness of spring.
 Higher 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 value spring require larger force to produce displacement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general any force that is directly proportional to displacement of object
 and in opposite directiron to displacement is known as harmonic oscillator
 force.
 Such a force causes oscillations of the object-which is a periodic motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Friction force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The force of friction is yet another type of contact force that exists between
 surfaces in contact.
 There are three kinds friction forces that exist between solid surfaces.
 Static friction, sliding friction and rolling or kinetic friction.
 The friction force is always opposite to the direction of motion.
 Static friction tends to oppose the motion of an object kept at rest.
 It is found that the friction force directly proportional to the normal
 reaction.
 In case of static friction, the maximum or the limiting value of force
 of friction is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{S}=\mu_{S}N;
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S}$
\end_inset

 is known as coefficient of static friction.
 Once the object starts moving the friction force decreases and is known
 as sliding friction.
 The sliding friction is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{K}=\mu_{K}N;
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{K}$
\end_inset

 is known as coefficient of kinetic friction.
 In case of a round object rolling such as a wheel, the friction force that
 exists between the surfaces is known as rolling friction.
 The value of rolling friction is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{R}=\mu_{R}N.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In general it is found that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{S}>\mu_{K}>\mu_{R}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Friction force is a non-conservative force.
 Presence of friction causes the mechanical energy to decrease or convert
 into heat energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Viscosity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viscosity can be considered as a friction force that exists between fluids
 and/or fluids and solids.
 In general viscosity is a force that tends to depend upon the relative
 motion n speed of the adjacent parts of fluids.
 Such a fluid is known as viscous fluid.
 Viscosity like friction is a non-conservative force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Uniform circular motion-centripetal force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often we come across examples of motion in which an object revolves in circular
 path around a point called the center.
 A merry-go-round, a stone tied to a string when revolved, a fan rotating
 around its axis, the earth revolving around sun or the moon revolving around
 earth, an electron revolving around nucleus are all examples of motion
 known as circular motion.
 Circular motion is only possible if there exists a force that binds the
 object towards the center; such a force is therefore called the centripetal
 force.
 In uniform circular motion the speed of object remains constant while its
 direction keeps on changing; hence it is an accelerated motion, the correspondi
ng acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.
 Centripetal force is not a new kind of force but is just a term given in
 reference to uniform circular motion.
 The centripetal force can be any of the forces previously discussed.
 For example in the case of a stone tied to string, the force that keeps
 the stone in its path is the tension force; hence tension is the centripetal
 force in this case.
 In the case of earth revolving around sun, the centripetal force is the
 gravitational force between the sun and the earth.
 In the case of the electron it is the electromagnetic force which binds
 it to the nucleus is the centripetal force.

If the centripetal force is due to gravity we have the Newton's law of gravitati
on.
 If it is electromagnetic force we have the Coulomb's law.
 But in most cases it may not possible to find an exact formula for centripetal
 force.
 But one can still calculate the value of centripetal force based on the
 properties of the object that revolves.
 Consider a stone of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 tied to a string of length 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and is being revolved with a constant speed of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

.
 The formula for centripetal force is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In case of the stone as long as the stone keeps revolving the tension force
 is the centripetal force and we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If we observe from the frame of reference of the object the object feels
 the force which pushes it away from the center (due to inertia).
 This force is known as centrifugal force.
 The centrifugal force is not a “real” force — the tendency to fly outwards
 is observed because objects that are moving in a straight line tend to
 continue moving in a straight line.
 This is called inertia, and it makes objects resistant to the force that
 makes them move in a curve.
 The value of the centrifugal force is also given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If an object is properly rotating, both the centrifugal and centripetal
 forces will be equal, so the object will not move towards the center of
 revolution or outwards from it.
 It will maintain a constant distance from the center.

The problem of satellite motion can easily be solved by making use of Newton's
 law of gravitation and centripetal force.
 Consider a satellite of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 which is to be launched at a definite height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 from the surface of the earth.
 Let mass of earth be 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and radius of earth be 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Now at this height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 the gravitational attraction due to earth must provide the centripetal
 force required to maintain the satellite in its orbit.
 In other words 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{G}=F_{C}.$
\end_inset

 If the speed of satellite is not sufficient then 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{C}<F_{G}$
\end_inset

 and the satellite will fall to the surface of earth.
 If speed of satellite is more so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{C}>F_{G}$
\end_inset

, then the satellite will escape the pull of earth.
 Thus to keep it revolving at some height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 it must be made to revolve with a definite speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 which will make 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{G}=F_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus if 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the required orbital speed then at this speed we must have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{G} & = & F_{C}\\
G\frac{Mm}{(R+h)^{2}} & = & \frac{mv^{2}}{(R+h)}\\
v^{2} & = & \frac{GM}{(R+h)}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

the required speed is therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R+h}}.\label{eq:sateliite-speed}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus the satellite if launched at the required height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 must be given this speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 in order to keep it revolving in its orbit.
 We can also obtain the time period of the satellite.
 Time period 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the time taken by the satellite to complete one revolution around the
 earth.
 In one revolution the distance covered by the satellite around the earth
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi(R+h)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
T & = & \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}\\
T & = & \frac{2\pi(R+h)}{v}\\
T^{2} & = & \frac{4\pi^{2}(R+h)^{2}}{v^{2}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Substituting the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sateliite-speed"

\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}(R+h)^{3}}{GM}.\label{eq:time-period}
\end{equation}

When a bike or car makes a turn at a road, the friction force prevents the
 bike or car from slipping off the track.
 However if the speed of the vehicle is large the friction force may not
 be sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force.
 In that case the bike may slip.
 So the maximum safe speed can be obtained easily.
 If the mass of the bike is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and the coefficient of static friction of the track is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S}$
\end_inset

 and radius of the turning arc is 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 then we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_{S}N & = & \frac{mv_{\text{safe}}^{2}}{r}\\
\mu_{S}mg & = & \frac{mv_{\text{safe}}^{2}}{r}\\
v_{\text{safe}} & = & \sqrt{\mu_{S}rg}.

\begin_layout Section
Concept of work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In physics the concepts of work and energy are extremely useful tools to
 solve many physical problems.
 A principle known as the conservation of energy is a central idea behind
 the happenings of any process in the entire universe.
 The idea of work or energy can be assumed to be developed parallel to the
 idea of force although we will begin the concept of work as a result of
 force.
 However it can be safely assumed that the conservation of energy can be
 used to effectively to predict the future of an event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a force acting on a body produces a change in its position; work
 is said to be done by the force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Work is measured by the product of the applied force and the displacement
 of the body in the direction of the force, i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{work}=\text{force}\times\text{displacement parallel to force}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Work is usually denoted with 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and if denote the distance with 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
W & =\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}\label{eq:workvectoreqn}\\
W & =Fd\cos\theta.
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the force and displacement.
 Thus work is a scalar product of force and displacement.
 The SI unit of work is 
\series bold
Joule
\series default
 written in symbol as 
\series bold
J
\series default
.
 We have
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $J=Nm$
\end_inset

.

\series default
 One can easily see that when both the displacement and force are parallel
 (or anti-parallel) the work done is maximum and when force and displacement
 are mutually perpendicular; the work done is zero.
 We later learn that positive work done increases the energy and negative
 work done decreases (dissipates) the energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work done by a constant force and constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 can be calculated with equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:workvectoreqn"

\end_inset

, but if during the course of the objects motion the work done keeps on
 changing or if the direction of the displacement keeps on changing, one
 must divide the motion into small enough segments and consider adding the
 work done during this small displacements (at which 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 may be treated constants) to calculate the total work done during the motion.
 In such a case the total work done may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\int\vec{F}\cdot\vec{dx}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $dx$
\end_inset

 denotes the small displacements in which the total displacement is broken
 into.
 Yet another way to calculate work done is through plotting the graph between
 the applied force and the displacement.
 If value of force is measured at each points of the displacement path and
 plotted on xy plane, the area covered by the force graph with the x-axis
 gives the total work done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The energy of a body is defined as its capacity of doing work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like work energy is also a scalar quantity and the dimensions are also identical
 to that of work.
 Therefore the SI unit of energy is also joule.
 In a mechanical system energy is mainly classified as being either Kinetic
 or Potential.
 Sum of Kinetic and Potential energies is called the total mechanical energy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Kinetic energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The energy possessed by a body due to its motion is called its kinetic energy.
 If an object of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is moving with a (constant) speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, then the kinetic energy possessed by the body is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\label{eq:keliner}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Just as force was related to acceleration through F = ma, so is work related
 to velocity through the Work-Energy Theorem.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{\text{net}}=\Delta K=K_{f}-K_{i}=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The net work done by all the forces on a body of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the body.
 Positive work done will increase the kinetic energy whereas the negative
 work done will decrease the kinetic energy of the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conservative forces and Potential Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the idea of work, we can classify forces as conservative or non-conserv
ative.
 A conservative force is a force which conserves the total mechanical energy
 of a body.
 A body moving under conservative force does not loose energy.

The electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces that is very
 well understood at almost all levels.
 It was known from ancient times that if we rub objects together then they
 acquire a special thing or property due to which the objects can attract
 or repel each other.
 This special thing that the objects acquired is known as charge.
 Charge will be denoted by the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and its unit is the coulomb or 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Now the property of charge must be looked as any other property of an object
 such as color, shape or even mass.
 Just like an object can possess the property of color it can possess charge.
 Now there are several key things about charge itself that we should pay
 attention to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Charge comes in two varieties
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Traditionally termed positive and negative, the two types of charges lead
 to both the attractive and repulsive forces.
 Forces between like charges are repulsive whereas between opposite charges
 are attractive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Charge is conserved
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The total charge in an isolated system always remains the same.
 In other words charges cannot be created or destroyed.
 Charges can be transferred from one body to other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Charge is quantized
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When we rub two objects together it is the electrons which move from one
 object to the other.
 Now the charge on an electron is 
\begin_inset Formula $e=1.6\times10^{-19}C$
\end_inset

.
 We can only transfer whole electrons on to other objects.
 It means the total charge on an object can be a multiple of the number
 of electrons charge i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=ne$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is an integer.

Force between two charges-Coulomb's law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coulomb a french engineer studied the forces between charged objects for
 several years and found a formula for the force between them.
 He measured the force to be proportional to the product of charges and
 inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
 In symbols if the charges are labeled as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}$

\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k=9\times10^{9}\,Nm^{2}/C^{2}$
\end_inset

 is an experimentally measured value.
 If the value of force is positive then it denotes repuslive force and attractiv
e if negative.
 In this formula it is assumed that the charges are placed in vacuum or
 air.
 If instead we place any medium such as a paper in between the charges,
 the force between the charges reduces by some factor.
 If we denote the vacuum force by 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}$
\end_inset

 then the force in a medium may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{1}=\frac{F_{0}}{\epsilon_{r}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{r}$
\end_inset

 by which the force reduces depends upon the type of material medium placed
 between the charges.
 It is a pure number and commonly know as dielectric constant of the material.
 It is also know as the relative permittivity of the medium.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{r}=1$
\end_inset

 for air.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 can further be written in terms of another fundamental constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}=8.8\times10^{-12}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{2}/Nm^{2}$
\end_inset

as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus we get for vacuum
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{0}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and for medium 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{1}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The product 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}=\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is known as the permittivity (absolute permittivity) of the medium.
 Thus we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{r}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}}=\frac{F_{0}}{F_{1}}.
\end{equation}

Electric Field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we are given magnets to play with we get fascinated by the way they
 exert forces onto one another even at a distance without any contact.
 This kind of non-contact behaviour of forces used to puzzle the great minds
 of Newton and Coulomb as well, since through a number of experiments we
 have come to know that we need some kind of contact to exert forces.
 Thus it was difficult for them to understand a force without contact.
 So in order to restore the contact idea, it was thought that the charges
 do exert forces via some kind of invisible contact.
 They thought that the charges gave some invisible property to the space
 around them due to which if any other charge entered into their proximity
 will experience the force of electricity.
 This invisible property is known as the Field.
 So every charge produces its own field known as the electric field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically a field (of any charge distribution) is a function of position
 and time; i.e.
 its value changes from point to point and also with time.
 Consider a situation in which some charge is kept hidden in a box.
 If we ask a question whether a charge exists within the box or not? This
 kind of question can not be answered just by looking at the box (since
 charge does not glow).
 In order to answer this question one can bring another charge and place
 it outside the box but near the box and measure the force (if any) acting
 onto the charge.

Electric field lines are a convenient way to visualise the presence of fields.
 The field lines can be drawn by imagining a curve drawn along the path
 followed by a positive charge.
 Thus the field lines are imaginary curves along which a positive charge
 would tend to move if it were free to do so.
 Lets take some examples.

 and converging (going inwards) for a single negative charge.

Electric field of a dipole
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A system of two equal but opposite charges separated by a small distance
 are known as a dipole.
 A dipole is electrically neutral yet in the proximity of a dipole the field
 of the dipole at any point may not be zero since the nearness of any one
 charge will contribute more field than the other.
 This causes certain residual field to be generated.
 The properties of this residual field are important not just for academic
 purpose but also for practical purpose since many molecules can be treated
 as dipoles to a good approximation.
 Just as value of charge denotes the strength of electric field produced
 by a single charge, in case of a dipole a related physical quantity called
 the dipole moment is of great significance.
 The symbol used for dipole moment is 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p=2aq.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Axis passing through the line joining the charges is known as the axis of
 the dipole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Axial point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine a point at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from the center of the dipole situated on the axis of the dipole, an axial
 point.
 We are interested in calculating the field produced by this dipole at this
 location.
 The net field at this point will be just the sum of the fields due to the
 positive and the negative charges.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{axial}}=E_{+q}+E_{-q}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, we can write the formulae for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{+q}$
\end_inset

 and and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{-q}$
\end_inset

 by making use of the formula of a field due to a single charge, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{+q}=\frac{kq}{\left(r-a\right)^{2}}\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,E_{-q}=\frac{kq}{\left(r+a\right)^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{axial}} & =\frac{kq}{\left(r-a\right)^{2}}-\frac{kq}{\left(r+a\right)^{2}}\\
E_{\text{axial}} & =\frac{k\left(4aq\right)r}{\left(r^{2}-a^{2}\right)^{2}}\\
E_{\text{axial}} & =k\frac{2pr}{\left(r^{2}-a^{2}\right)^{2}}\label{eq:dipole_axial}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dipole_axial"

\end_inset

 gives the value of the electric field for a dipole.
 If the point of observation lies far away from the tiny dipole i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gg a$
\end_inset

, then neglecting 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the denominator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{axial}} & =k\frac{2pr}{r^{4}}\\
E_{\text{axial}} & =k\frac{2p}{r^{3}};
\end{align}

\end_inset

the equation says that the dipole field falls off as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{3}$
\end_inset

 from the charge.

Consider now the point to be located at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 on the line passing through the center of the dipole and perperndicular
 to its axis i.e.
 its perpendicular bisector.
 Since the point of observation now lies at an eqaul distance from both
 the charges the fields of both the charges have same magnitude
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{+q}=E_{-q}=\frac{kq}{(r+a)^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

But as can be seen from the diagram; only the vertically downward components
 contribute to the total field whereas horizontal components being equal
 and opposite cancel out, thus we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{pb}} & =E_{+Q}\cos\theta+E_{-Q}\cos\theta\\
 & =2E_{+Q}\cos\theta
\end{align}

\end_inset

From the diagram we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta=\frac{a}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and so we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\text{pb}} & =2\frac{kq}{\left(r+a\right)^{2}}\times\frac{a}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}\\
E_{\text{pb}} & =\frac{\left(2aq\right)k}{\left(r^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\\
E_{\text{pb}} & =\frac{pk}{\left(r^{2}+a^{2}\right)^{3/2}}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

If the point of observation lies far away i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gg a$
\end_inset

 then neglecting 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}$
\end_inset

 in above equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{\text{pb}}=\frac{pk}{r^{3}}.

\begin_layout Section
Electrostatic potential energy and potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Till now the discussion has been based on the idea of force and field (force
 per unit charge).
 In mechanics we had an alternative but equivalent approach based on energy
 that allowed us to solve many problems without going into complicated calculati
ons involving forces.
 The electric force is also a conservative force.
 Therefore a natural question arises that if we have a collection of charges
 then what is the potential energy associated with it.
 This can be calculated by just calculating the work required to assemble
 the collection of charges.
 Let us start with the simplest configuration of collection of charges i.e.
 a pair of charges.
 Suppose we have two positive charges 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We shall treat the charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 as the source charge and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the test charge.
 Suppose initially the test charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 is at a distance of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 from the source charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and we want to bring it closer and place it at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For this we will have to do some work against the electric force of repulsion.
 The work done is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=F\times d\label{eq:workdoneele}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

now here we can write for the displacement 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d=y-x
\end{equation}

\end_inset

.
 But the value of force changes on the entire path.
 For example the value of forces at the intial and final points are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{x}=\frac{kqq_{1}}{x^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{y}=\frac{kqq_{1}}{y^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

So which of these should we use in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:workdoneele"

\end_inset

.
 The thing is that we have to take some kind of average of these two values.
 In this case since the force changes as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{2}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 as a geometric progression we can take a geometric average of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{y}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
F & =\sqrt{F_{x}F_{y}}\\
 & =\frac{kqq_{1}}{xy}
\end{align}

\end_inset

, and we have for 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:workdoneele"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
W & =\frac{kqq_{1}}{xy}\cdot\left(y-x\right)\\
W & =kqq_{1}\left(\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}\right)
\end{align}

\end_inset

This work done equals the change in potential energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\Delta U=U_{x}-U_{y}=kqq_{1}\left(\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus we can write for the potential energy of the system of source charge
 and test charge separated by distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U=\frac{kqq_{1}}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the potential energy it is easy to define potential.
 The potential at a point located at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 due to a single source charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is obtained by calculating the work done in bringing a unit positive (test)
 charge from infinity and placing it at 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 In other words it is the potential energy per unit charge, thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{W}{q_{1}}=\frac{U}{q_{1}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and thus for a single (source) charge the potential at any distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{kq}{r}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Unlike electric field potential is a scalar quantity.
 Its value is positive for a positive source charge and negative for a negative
 source charge.
 When we have a collection of charges the potential at a point is just the
 algebraic sum of potentials due to individual charges at respective distances.

Flux, Gauss' law and its applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flux of an electric field through any surface area is the number of
 field lines that pass through the area.
 If we have a closed surface that encloses a volume, then the total flux
 is the number of field lines entering minus the number of field lines leaving
 the surface.
 The field lines entering is the influx whereas those leaving is the out
 flux.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{flux}=\text{in flux}-\text{out flux}
\]

Electric current
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flow of charge from one point to the other is termed as electric current.
 Charges can be put in motion by creating a potential difference or voltage.
 Traditionally the motion of charges from higher potential(voltage) to lower
 potential(voltage) is termed as current and it is due to the movement of
 positive charges.
 However in actual circuits current is due to the motion of negatively charged
 electrons from lower potential to higher potential.
 In general only conductors allow for easy movement of charges due to the
 presence of fee electrons.
 Thus if we apply some potential difference across the ends of a conductor
 then current through the conductor is defined as the amount of (positive)
 charges that flow about a cross section in unit time,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{Q}{t}.
